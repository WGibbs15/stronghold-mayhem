## \[0.6.0]

- - Refactor Sink and Stream implementation for EventChannel
- Add `CopyRecord` procedure.
- In the `StrongholdP2p` Interface enable / disable mdns and relay functionality on init via config flags in the `StrongholdP2pBuilder`. Per default, both are enabled.
- In the `Stronghold` client interface enable / disable mdns and relay in the `NetworkConfig` when spawning a new p2p-network actor. Per default, both are disabled.
- Use `libp2p::swarm::toggle` to enable/ disable relay and mdns
- Persist config and keypair of stronghold-p2p in client
- Implement messages to write the keypair used for `StrongholdP2p` in the vault and derive the `PeerId` and a new noise `AuthenticKeypair` from it.
- Implement API for the Stronghold Procedures
- Make stronghold interface clonable
- Update inline Docs and README files to reflect the current state of the project.
- Add communication fuzzer for distributed fuzzing with docker.
- Patch Stronghold engine fuzzer.
- Patch crypto.rs version v0.7 -> v0.8.
- Persist the state of stronghold-p2p in the `SecureClient` by serializing the `NetworkConfig` and writing it to the store.
- Allow loading stored states into the `NetworkActor` on init.
- Allow reuse of same `Keypair` that is stored in the vault.
- Software transactional memory framework as replacement for actix actor system
- Integration is runtime agnostic an can be used by any async runtime for rust, tkio is encouraged though
- Extract `random` functions from `test_utils` into own module.
- Remove Riker as dependency from utils.
- Introduce KeyProvider instead of repeatedly providing a passphrase.
- Introduce non-contiguous memory types for secure key handling.
- Abstract over locked and encrypted data types for use internally.
- Stronghold interface rewrite to work on type level with Stronghold as root type, Client as secure container, Store as insecure storage and ClientVault as vault access.
